Updates
-----------
    These proxy lists are updated daily.

## Filters
    1. None of the provided proxies are flagged as bad proxies.  
    2. All proxies are tested before updating.
    3. Every Proxy is unique
    4. All proxies are tested on 20ms timeout

## Automation
* The bot runs continuously on GitHub servers and collects data from various webpages every day.
* The data is gathered through APIs provided by these sites.
* The raw data is filtered to remove duplicates and unknown formats.
* After filtering, the data is passed through a validation checking section where it is determined whether the proxy is good or bad. (Validation section is disabled right now).
* Finally, the data is sent to the commit section, where it updates the old proxies on GitHub.
