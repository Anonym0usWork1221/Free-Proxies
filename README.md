Updates
-----------
    These Proxy lists update Daily

## Filters
    1. None of these given proxies are bad proxies.  
    2. Script test all proxies before updating
    3. Every Proxy is unique
    4. All proxies are tested on 20ms timeout

## Automation
* The bot runs continuously on GitHub servers and collects data from various webpages every day.
* The data is gathered through APIs provided by these sites.
* The raw data is filtered to remove duplicates and unknown formats.
* After filtering, the data is passed through a validation checking section where it is determined whether the proxy is good or bad.
* Finally, the data is sent to the commit section, where it updates the old proxies on GitHub.
